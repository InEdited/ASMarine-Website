                        RoboSub is a thrilling competition characterized by a chilling atmosphere and charged with a competitive spirit. Since its start back in 1998, RoboSub has attracted the top-talent young engineers from all over the globe to compete and show their skills in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) design, fabrication and operation.

                        The competition is comprised of multiple evaluation stages starting from static judging and technical design reviews all the way up to product demonstration and underwater mission execution.

                        Missions include a set of challenging tasks like penetrating underwater gates, following some pipelines and path markers, detecting distinctive images underwater, mapping buoys, shooting fancy-looking torpedoes, dropping objects into special bins, locating acoustic beacons, and manipulating objects, Tasks that mainly require a very robust control system as well as sound perception of the environment using special sensors and mapping algorithms.

                                Through a process of systematic design and thorough testing, our engineers built a vehicle equipped with three cameras, an inertial measurement unit, a mapping sonar, a pressure sensor and an array of hydrophones. Our engineers also developed an entire system architecture composed of carefully designed mapping algorithms, detection, depth estimation and robust control modules.
